    <string name="tac1">Terms of Service
\n\nLast Updated: March 31, 2023 (Section A)\n\n
SECTION A TERMS\n\n
Introduction and Overview\n\n
Thank you for choosing the Bill Tracker app. Bill Tracker, along with any parent, subsidiary, affiliate, or related companies are referred to in these provisions as “Bill Tracker Group” or simply “Bill Tracker” or “us.”\n
When you use the app, you enter into a binding contract with us. Each section of the agreement begins with an italicized annotation that is intended to help you navigate the agreement. The annotations do not completely
        summarize the agreement, though, and you should read each section carefully and in full. We’ve also bolded a few areas that talk about important legal rights, and you should be sure to read those sections carefully.
        These provisions in Section A apply to the app generally.\n
If you are an individual acting on your company’s or client’s behalf, you accept these provisions on their behalf and the term “you” will refer to you, your company, or your client.\n\n
Agreement to These Terms\n\n
    </string>
    <string name="tac2">
You need to agree to these terms to use our app. Bill Tracker will not share your personal information with third parties, unless specifically instructed to do so by you in order to provide additional services within the app.\n
To access and/or use the app, you acknowledge and agree:\n\n
To the terms and conditions of this agreement (“Agreement”), which includes:\n\n
The current version of the terms set out in Section A and:\n\n
Any additional provisions and conditions provided separately to you for your use of the app, which may include terms and conditions from third parties (which we refer to as “Additional Terms”)\n\n
You are at least 18 years of age;\n
You are capable of forming a binding contract with Bill Tracker; and\n
You are not a person who is prohibited from using the app under the laws of the United States, or any other applicable jurisdiction.\n\n
Your Personal Information\n\n
We want to be transparent about how we use personal information and about your rights in our Privacy Statement. You should only provide us with personal information of others if you have received permission to do so.\n
You agree that Bill Tracker may use and maintain your personal information to provide services within the scope of the app.\n
To the extent we allow you to input personal information (as the term is defined under applicable law) about other individuals other than yourself, you represent and warrant that you have complied with all applicable laws and
        received the proper authority or consent to allow us to collect and process such information to operate our business. You agree such sharing does not constitute a “sale” of information as defined under the California Consumer
        Privacy Act (CCPA).\n\n
Changes\n\n
    </string>
    <string name="tac3">
Change happens. When it does happen, we will update this Agreement. If the changes are material, you may need to accept the changes to use the app. Similarly, there may be circumstances where we need to update or discontinue the app.\n
We may modify the provisions of this Agreement at any time. We may notify you of such modifications by posting through the app or by other means. It is important that you review this Agreement whenever we modify it because your
        continued use of the app indicates your agreement to the modifications.\n
In some cases, you may need to accept changes to this Agreement to continue using the app. If you do not agree to these changes, you may stop using the app or terminate your account.\n
Similarly, we may update the app, including with tools, utilities, improvements or third party applications. You agree to receive these updates. We may further modify, suspend or discontinue the app at any time. You agree that we
        will not be liable to you or any third party for any modification, suspensions, or discontinuance of the app.\n\n
Your Rights to Use the app\n\n
You can use our app for your own personal and lawful use or as otherwise permitted under this Agreement.\n
You may access and use the app for your own internal, lawful and non-commercial purposes only.\n\n
Beta Features\n\n
We may provide you with access to beta features in the app. You are free to use them, but they are provided as-is.\n
We may include new and/or updated pre-release and trial features in the app and such features are provided as-is. Your use of such features is at no additional cost but you must follow additional rules or restrictions that we may
        place on their use.\n\n
Account\n\n
    </string>
    <string name="tac4">
You will provide accurate, up-to-date account information and securely manage such information.\n
You may need to sign up for an account to use the app. We may need to verify your identity, and you authorize us to collect information (e.g., date of birth, address) from you to do so (collectively, with all information requested
        to enable your account, “Account Information”). You will provide accurate, up-to-date Account Information, and we disclaim any liability arising from your failure to do so. Such failure may further limit your ability to use
        the app and affect the app’s accuracy and effectiveness.\n
You are responsible for securely managing your Account Information, including any password(s) for the app. You will notify us immediately if you believe that your Account Information or device you use to access the app has been lost
        or stolen or that someone is using your account without your permission.\n\n

        parties, which could impact whether, how and where the services and products are displayed.\n

        graphics, images, audio, video that are uploaded, transmitted, posted, generated, stored, or otherwise made available through the app. You have no obligation to provide any content to the app, and you’re free to choose
        the content that you want to provide. You acknowledge certain functionality in the app may be dependent on the provision of Content and may not be available without such Content.\n\n

Effect of Termination\n\n
        </string>

Bill Tracker Communications\n\n
We may contact you from time to time to support your use of the app.\n
In order to properly support and serve you, we occasionally need to reach out and contact you, and may do so in a variety of ways such as via text message, email or messaging functionality in the app. We want to provide you options
        for receiving communications from us, and as such you may opt-in or opt-out of receiving certain types of communications from us or sign up to receive certain kinds of messages from us, depending on the app. You will need to
        notify us of any changes to your contact details to ensure your preferences are updated.\n\n
Third Party Account Information\n\n
    </string>
    <string name="tac12">
Bill Tracker is not responsible for any account information obtained from third parties.\n
When you direct Bill Tracker to retrieve your account information from third parties, you grant Bill Tracker a limited power of attorney to access the third party services to retrieve such account information. Bill Tracker will be
        acting as your agent and will not be acting on behalf of the third party.\n
Bill Tracker does not review third party account information for accuracy and is not responsible for any issues or expenses resulting from such account information, including any inaccuracy, error, delay, or non-delivery. For clarity,
        Bill Tracker is not responsible for any payment processing errors or fees arising from inaccurate account information provided by third parties.\n\n
Disclaimers\n\n
We don’t make any warranties about the app except as expressly stated in this Agreement.\n
The only warranties we make about the app are (1) stated in this Agreement, or (2) as provided under applicable laws. The app is otherwise provided “as-is,” and we do not make any other warranties about the app. Unless required by law,
        we do not provide implied warranties, such as the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. We do not warrant that the app is error-free, secure, or free from any viruses or
    </string>
    <string name="tac13">
    other harmful components. We also do not provide any warranties with respect to data loss or to the accuracy, reliability, or availability of the app, nor of any content (including any Content) or information made available in
        the app. If the exclusions for implied warranties do not apply to you, any implied warranties are limited to sixty (60) days from the date of purchase or delivery of the app, whichever is sooner.\n\n
Limitation of Liability\n\n
Our liability is limited when it comes to issues you may encounter with our app.\n
Other than the rights and responsibilities described in this Agreement and as allowed by applicable law, Bill Tracker won’t be responsible for any losses.\n
The Bill Tracker app is provided free of charge, and as such, it is understood and agreed upon by you that Bill Tracker will not be held liable for any damages incurred as a result of the download, use, or installation of the app or
        any third party services offered by Bill Tracker.\n
The Bill Tracker Parties won’t be responsible for the following:\n\n
Loss of data, profits, revenues, business opportunities, goodwill or anticipated savings;\n\n
Indirect, incidental, or consequential loss; or\n\n
Punitive damages.\n\n
    </string>
    <string name="tac14">
The above limitations apply even if the Bill Tracker Parties have been advised of the possibility of such damages. This Agreement sets forth your exclusive remedy with respect to the app and its use.\n
If you’re legally exempt from certain responsibilities, including indemnification, then those responsibilities don’t apply to you under this Agreement. For example, the United Nations enjoys certain immunities from legal obligations
        and this Agreement doesn’t override those immunities.\n\n
Indemnity Obligations\n\n
If someone sues us because you used the app unlawfully or didn’t follow our rules, you will be responsible for any harm to us.\n
You will indemnify and hold harmless the Bill Tracker Parties for any losses, damages, judgments, fines, costs and expenses (including legal fees) in connection with any claims arising out of or relating to your unlawful or
        unauthorized use of the app or violation of this Agreement. Bill Tracker reserves the right, in its sole discretion and at its own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any claims. You agree to reasonably
        cooperate as requested by Bill Tracker in the defense of any claims.\n\n
Disputes\n\n
In the event we are unable to resolve any dispute through an informal dialogue, a third-party arbitrator or small claims court will help us resolve any disputes we might have, and any disputes will be resolved on an individual basis
        rather than as a class action.\n\n
If you are a U.S. customer:\n\n
        </string>
    <string name="tac15">
You and Bill Tracker agree that, except as provided below, any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating in any way to the app or this Agreement (a “Claim”) will be determined by binding arbitration or small claims
        court, instead of in courts of general jurisdiction.
Either you or Bill Tracker can seek to have a Claim resolved in small claims court if all the requirements of the small claims court are satisfied. Either you or Bill Tracker may seek to have a Claim resolved in small claims court
        in your county of residence or the small claims court in closest proximity to your residence, and you may also bring a claim in small claims court in the Superior Court of California, County of Santa Clara.
Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators
        can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. You agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration provision, and that you and Bill Tracker are each
        </string>
    <string name="tac16">
            waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement and/or the termination of your account.
If you elect to seek arbitration, you must first send to Bill Tracker a written notice of your Claim ("Notice of Claim"). The Notice of Claim to Bill Tracker should be sent in care of our registered agent Corporation Service Company,
        251 Little Falls Drive, Wilmington, DE 19808. The Notice of Claim should include both the mailing address and email address you would like Bill Tracker to use to contact you. If Bill Tracker elects to seek arbitration, it will
        send, by certified mail, a written Notice of Claim to your address on file. A Notice of Claim, whether sent by you or by Bill Tracker, must (a) describe the nature and basis of the Claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the
        specific amount of damages or other relief sought.
You and Bill Tracker agree that good-faith informal efforts to resolve disputes often can result in a prompt, low-cost and mutually beneficial outcome. You and Bill Tracker therefore agree that, after a Notice of Claim is sent but
        before either you or Bill Tracker commence arbitration or file a Claim in small claims court against the other, we will personally meet, via telephone or videoconference, in a good-faith effort to confer with each other and
        try to resolve informally any Claim covered by this Agreement. If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference as well, but you agree to fully participate in the conference. Likewise, if
    </string>
    <string name="tac17">
        Bill Tracker is represented by counsel, its counsel may participate in the conference as well, but Bill Tracker agrees to have a company representative fully participate in the conference. The statute of limitations and any
        filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the informal dispute resolution process required by this paragraph.
If we do not reach an agreement to resolve the Claim within sixty (60) days after the Notice of Claim is received, you or Bill Tracker may commence an arbitration proceeding by filing a Demand for Arbitration or, alternatively, by
        filing a Claim in small claims court. You agree that you may not commence any arbitration or file a Claim in small claims court unless you and Bill Tracker are unable to resolve the Claim within sixty (60) days after we
        receive your completed Notice of Claim and you have made a good faith effort to resolve your claim directly with Bill Tracker during that time. If a Claim qualifies for small claims court, but a party commences an
        arbitration proceeding, you and Bill Tracker agree that either party may elect instead to have the Claim resolved in small claims court, and upon written notice of a party’s election, the American Arbitration Association
        (“AAA”) will administratively close the arbitration proceeding. Any dispute about whether a Claim qualifies for small claims court shall be resolved by that court, not by an arbitrator. In the event of any such dispute,
        the arbitration proceeding shall remain closed unless and until a decision by the small claims court that the Claim should proceed in arbitration. You may download or copy a form of notice and a form to initiate arbitration
    </string>
    <string name="tac18">
        at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. The arbitration will be conducted by the AAA before a single AAA arbitrator under the AAA’s rules, which are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879, except
        as modified by this Agreement. Unless Bill Tracker and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of either your residence or of the mailing address you provided in your Notice of Claim.
The arbitrator will be either (1) a retired judge or (2) an attorney specifically licensed to practice law in the state of California or the state of your residence and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s National Roster of
        Arbitrators. The arbitrator will be selected using the following procedure: (a) the AAA will send the parties a list of five candidates meeting this criteria; (b) if the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator from the list,
        each party shall return its list to the AAA within 10 days, striking up to two candidates, and ranking the remaining candidates in order of preference; © the AAA shall appoint as arbitrator the candidate with the highest
        aggregate ranking; and (d) if for any reason the appointment cannot be made according to this procedure, the AAA may exercise its discretion in appointing the arbitrator. The arbitrator is bound by this Agreement. Except
        as otherwise provided below, all issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision.
    </string>
    <string name="tac19">
        The parties agree that an administrative conference with the AAA shall be conducted in each arbitration proceeding, and you and an Bill Tracker company representative shall appear at the administrative conference via telephone. If you
        fail to appear at the administrative conference, regardless of whether your counsel attends, the AAA will administratively close the arbitration proceeding without prejudice, unless you show good cause as to why you were not
        able to attend the conference.
The arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. The award shall be binding only among the parties and shall have no preclusive effect in
        any other arbitration or other proceeding involving a different party. Bill Tracker will not seek to recover its attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration from you unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your
        Claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). Judgment on any award may be
        entered in any court having jurisdiction. This agreement to arbitrate shall not preclude any party to the arbitration from at any time seeking injunctions or other forms of equitable relief in aid of arbitration from a court
        of appropriate jurisdiction including whether a Demand for Arbitration is filed in violation of this Agreement.
    </string>
    <string name="tac20">
        Unless you or Bill Tracker seek to have a Claim resolved in small claims court, the arbitrator shall determine all issues of liability on the merits of any Claim asserted by you or Bill Tracker and may award declaratory or injunctive
        relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party\'s individual claim. To the extent that you or Bill Tracker prevail on a Claim and seek
        public injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief that has the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the public), the entitlement to and extent of such relief must be
        litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. The parties agree that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any individual
        Claims in arbitration. Before a court of competent jurisdiction issues any public injunctive relief, it shall review the factual findings of the arbitration award on which any injunction would issue with no deference to the
    </string>
    <string name="tac21">
        arbitrator.
Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. You are required to pay AAA’s initial filing fee, but Bill Tracker will reimburse you for this filing fee at the conclusion of the
        arbitration to the extent it exceeds the fee for filing a complaint in a federal or state court in your county of residence or in Santa Clara County, California. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your
        Claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all
        fees will be governed by the AAA Rules and Bill Tracker will not reimburse your initial filing fee. The parties agree that the AAA has discretion to modify the amount or timing of any administrative or arbitration fees
        due under the AAA Rules where it deems appropriate, provided that such modification does not increase the AAA fees to you or Bill Tracker, and you and Bill Tracker waive any objection to such fee modification.
You and Bill Tracker agree that each may bring Claims against the other only in your or its individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. Further, if you have
